# MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow

## 1. Mission

This agentic workflow appears to be designed for a recruitment process, specifically aimed at evaluating candidates and providing them with information about a job and company. It leverages three AI agents: `cv_analyst_agent`, `hr_info_agent`, and `interviewer_agent`. The `cv_analyst_agent` analyzes candidate CVs to assess their suitability for the role, generating a score, summary, and follow-up interview questions.  The `hr_info_agent` answers candidate queries about the job and company, providing candid information. Finally, the `interviewer_agent` crafts personalized messages incorporating the CV analysis and posing targeted interview questions. The system aims to automate parts of the initial screening and interviewing process, potentially improving efficiency and consistency in hiring decisions.  The workflow is orchestrated by generic tasks (`cv_task`, `interview_task`, `qa_task`) that define the interaction with each agent.

## 2. Assets

| Asset | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agents** |  |
| `cv_analyst_agent` | Analyzes CVs, scores candidates, generates interview questions. |
| `hr_info_agent` | Provides job and company information to candidates. |
| `interviewer_agent` | Crafts personalized messages with score, rationale, and interview questions. |
| **Tools/Functions** |  |
| LLM (OpenAI) | Used by all agents for text generation and processing. |
| CV Context Data | The content of the candidate's CV. |
| Job Context Data | Information about the job role. |
| Base Context Data | Company information used by `hr_info_agent`. |
| **Data Types** |  |
| Text (CV, Job Description, Questions) | Primarily text-based data for analysis and generation. |
| JSON (Score, Summary, Interview Questions) | Structured output from the CV analyst agent.

## 3. Entrypoints

| Entrypoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `cv_task` | Receives the candidate's CV and triggers the `cv_analyst_agent`. |
| `qa_task` | Receives user questions about the job/company and triggers the `hr_info_agent`. |
| `interview_task` |  Receives context data (CV analysis, job details) and triggers the `interviewer_agent`. |
| User Input (via QA Task) | Direct interaction with the `hr_info_agent` through user questions.

## 4. Security Controls

*   **Limited Delegation:** The agents have `allow_delegation` set to false, suggesting a degree of isolation between them.
*   **Verbose Logging:** Agents are configured for verbose logging which can be used for auditing and debugging.
*   **LLM Configuration:**  Uses OpenAI models with configurable settings (though specific configurations aren't detailed).
*   **Expected Output Definitions:** The tasks have defined expected output formats, potentially enabling validation of agent responses.

## 5. Threats

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Injection/Jailbreaking (Interviewer Agent)** | High | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Data Poisoning (CV Analysis)** | Medium | High | Medium-High |
| **Malicious CV Content (CV Analyst Agent)** | High | Medium | Medium-High |
| **HR Info Agent Misinformation** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **LLM Response Manipulation (All Agents)** | High | Medium | Medium-High |
| **Model Stealing (OpenAI LLMs)** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Denial of Service (QA Task)** | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| **Compromised OpenAI API Key** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Backdoor in Framework Components** | Low | High | Medium |
| **Goal Misalignment due to Backstory Instructions** | Medium | Medium | Medium |

## 6. Risks

The primary risk stems from the agents' reliance on LLMs and their susceptibility to prompt injection attacks, particularly affecting the `interviewer_agent`. A malicious actor could craft prompts that cause the agent to reveal sensitive information, generate inappropriate interview questions, or even impersonate a human interviewer. Data poisoning of the CV analysis process could lead to biased scoring and unfair hiring decisions. Malicious content embedded within candidate CVs can exploit vulnerabilities in the `cv_analyst_agent`, potentially leading to code execution or data exfiltration. The `hr_info_agent` is vulnerable to providing inaccurate or misleading information, damaging the company's reputation.  Compromise of the OpenAI API key would grant an attacker access to all agent interactions and potentially allow them to manipulate responses at scale.

## 7. Operations

The workflow operates sequentially: a candidate’s CV is analyzed by `cv_analyst_agent`, then the `interviewer_agent` generates interview questions based on the analysis, while simultaneously the `hr_info_agent` answers user queries about the job and company.  Monitoring should focus on agent output for anomalies (e.g., unexpected language, inappropriate content), API usage patterns to detect potential abuse, and error rates within each agent’s processing pipeline. Operational practices should include regular audits of agent configurations and prompt engineering techniques to mitigate injection vulnerabilities. A robust logging system is crucial for tracing the flow of data and identifying suspicious activity.

## 8. Recommendations

1.  **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization across all agents, especially for the `interviewer_agent` and when processing CV content.
2.  **Prompt Engineering Best Practices:** Employ robust prompt engineering techniques to minimize vulnerability to prompt injection attacks. Utilize guardrails and safety filters specifically tailored to each agent's function.
3.  **Data Validation & Sanitization (CV Analysis):** Implement data validation and sanitization routines for candidate CVs to prevent malicious code execution or data exfiltration.
4.  **API Key Security:** Securely store and manage OpenAI API keys, limiting access and rotating them regularly. Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding.
5.  **Regular Audits & Red Teaming:** Conduct regular security audits and red teaming exercises to identify vulnerabilities and test the effectiveness of existing controls.
6.  **Implement Rate Limiting (QA Task):** Implement rate limiting on the `qa_task` to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
7.  **Monitor Agent Output & API Usage:** Continuously monitor agent output for anomalies and track API usage patterns to detect suspicious activity.
8.  **Consider a Sandbox Environment:** Run agents in isolated sandbox environments to limit the impact of potential breaches.
9. **Backstory Review**: Regularly review agent backstories to ensure they don't inadvertently encourage unsafe behavior or provide overly permissive instructions.
